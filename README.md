# Style-Tranfer
This project displays the usecase of a pretrained vgg model (CNN) for style transfer. The 2 images are all thats needed to run the provided notebook.

## Limitations

Due to the short deadline, I had to resort to a pretrained model. Given a chance I would have loved to build this model from scratch to display my skills regardless of the final outcome of the project. 
As for the results, I could only run the model for a limited number of iterations, but given enough computational power we could surely generate much better results.
